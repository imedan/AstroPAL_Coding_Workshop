# General Advice

Below is some general advice/resources we wanted to provide all of you incase you wanted to explore some more interesting packages/methods after the workshop!

## Astronomy Python Packages

* **[Astropy](https://www.astropy.org)**:  Large collection of software packages written in Python for astronomy

* **[Galpy](https://docs.galpy.org/en/latest/)**: Python package for galactic dynamics

* **[Dustmaps](https://dustmaps.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)**:  2D/3D dust maps used to estimate reddening written in Python

* **[AstroML](https://www.astroml.org)**: Python machine learning/data mining package made specifically for astronomers

* **[Lightkurve](https://docs.lightkurve.org)**: Python package for accessing and analyzing Kepler and TESS data

* **[Glue](https://glueviz.org)**: Multidimensional data visualization tool written in Python. This was made by
astronomers, so has a lot of things built in that are astronomy specific.

* **[Astrodendro](https://dendrograms.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)**: Python package for making dendrograms, specifically written in Python for applications within astronomy. (If you donâ€™t know what dendrograms are, they are useful for identifying 2D features in images).
