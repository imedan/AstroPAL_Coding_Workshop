# General Advice

Below is some general advice/resources we wanted to provide all of you in case you wanted to explore some more interesting packages/methods after the workshop!

## Astronomy Python Packages

* **[Astropy](https://www.astropy.org)**:  Large collection of software packages written in Python for astronomy

* **[Galpy](https://docs.galpy.org/en/latest/)**: Python package for galactic dynamics

* **[Dustmaps](https://dustmaps.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)**:  2D/3D dust maps used to estimate reddening written in Python

* **[AstroML](https://www.astroml.org)**: Python machine learning/data mining package made specifically for astronomers

* **[Lightkurve](https://docs.lightkurve.org)**: Python package for accessing and analyzing Kepler and TESS data

* **[Glue](https://glueviz.org)**: Multidimensional data visualization tool written in Python. This was made by
astronomers, so has a lot of things built in that are astronomy specific.

* **[Astrodendro](https://dendrograms.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)**: Python package for making dendrograms, specifically written in Python for applications within astronomy. (If you don’t know what dendrograms are, they are useful for identifying 2D features in images).

## IDL Packages

* **[Homepage for everything astro IDL](https://idlastro.gsfc.nasa.gov/)**

* **[Short descriptions of each function](https://idlastro.gsfc.nasa.gov/contents.html)**

* **[Github for IDLAstro](https://github.com/wlandsman/IDLAstro)**

* **[sym.pro](https://lesia.obspm.fr/kronos/routines/sym-code.html)**: package for plotting

* **[Plotting with Latex language](http://physics.mnstate.edu/craig/textoidl/textoidl-2-1-2/textoidl.pro)**

* **[Curve Fitting](https://epics.anl.gov/bcda/dataVis/idl_html/CurvFitRef.html)**

## Random Advice

* Comment your code (just do it!)

* Give your variables appropriate names

* Backup everything (see Github discussion)

* Having trouble finding the error?

	* Print things out (brute force way)
	
	* Learn to use a debugger

* When first using a script, run it on a smaller, test dataset

* Don’t go editing your original data source

* Make your code easier to read with a [linter](http://www.sublimelinter.com/en/stable/)
