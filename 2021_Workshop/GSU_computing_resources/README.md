# Accessing GSU Computing Resources

Through the astronomy department, you have access to many computing resources that you will most likely need to use at some point during your graduate career. At the beginning of your first year, you should be given login credentials that you can then use to access these resources either on campus or at home. Generally, to access the computing resources from your computer you can ssh into the network like:

	ssh __*username*__@joy.chara.gsu.edu

If you are off campus, you will need to login to the [GSU VPN](https://technology.gsu.edu/technology-services/it-services/security/virtual-private-network/) to access the network. Once on joy, you should login to your respective computer and **not do your work on joy**. Doing your work on joy will slow down the entire network and make logging in for others difficult. To do this, simply ssh to your domain once on joy using the following:

	ssh __*username*__@__*domain*__
